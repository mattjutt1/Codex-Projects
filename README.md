# MoodMakeover

# MoodMakeover is a cross-platform mobile application that leverages augmented reality (AR) for dopamine-inducing decor transformations.

Users can point their device cameras at their living spaces and instantly preview virtual decorations—furniture, artwork, lighting effects—overlaid in real time, helping spark creativity and elevate mood.

## Goals
- Enable AR-based “dopamine decor” to empower users to reimagine their environments
- Provide a library of 3D assets and visual effects for mood-boosting transformations
- Offer intuitive controls for placing, scaling, and customizing AR content

## Technology Stack
- **Framework:** React Native (TypeScript)
- **AR:** Viro React (or Expo AR)
- **Project Setup:** Expo (managed workflow)
- **Styling & Linting:** ESLint, Prettier
- **Testing & CI:** Jest, React Native Testing Library, GitHub Actions

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the Expo development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Next Steps
- Run `expo init` with the `expo-template-blank-typescript` template if you haven't yet.
- Integrate AR components and 3D asset pipeline.
- Set up unit and integration tests.
